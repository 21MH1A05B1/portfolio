- A dynamic **Homepage** with a theme toggle to reflect my current "mood".
- A personal **About page** with a short story of how I got into frontend.
- Two real projects with clean UI, descriptions, and code snippets.

## ❤️ Favorite Part of Building This

Creating the mood toggle was super fun — it felt like giving the site a bit of personality! Also, crafting the story on the About page made me reflect on why I love frontend development in the first place.

## 🤯 Hardest Part

Getting the Tailwind dark mode transitions smooth and theme-aware took some trial and error. I handled it by breaking the UI down and testing each state, then using Tailwind’s `dark:` variants smartly.
